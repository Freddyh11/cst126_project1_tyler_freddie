Module 3: Project 1
Write a program that stores stock symbols into dynamic arrays.
Your menu-based program should include the following options:

● Add a new stock
Include room for the stock symbol, the name of the stock, and the current price.

● Edit a stock
Provide the ability to locate a stock based on its name OR stock symbol. Only the price 
need be changed.

● Delete a stock
Offers the user the opportunity to enter a stock symbol and, if found, to delete the 
stock. If the stock symbol is NOT found, an informative message is displayed.

● Display all stocks
Display a list of all the current stocks stored in your array.

● Sort the stocks 
Offers the user the chance to sort in either ascending or descending order.

Meet to exchange contact information, best times to connect and when you will meet to

After the code is “working,” meet as a team to plan how you will test the code. The
 testing then may be completed as a team or individually. Be sure that you write up your
testing plan to submit with the final project.
